    "# Examining Racial Discrimination in the US Job Market\n",
    "\n",
    "### Background\n",
    "Racial discrimination continues to be pervasive in cultures throughout the world. Researchers examined the level of racial discrimination in the United States labor market by randomly assigning identical résumés to black-sounding or white-sounding names and observing the impact on requests for interviews from employers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data\n",
    "In the dataset provided, each row represents a resume. The 'race' column has two values, 'b' and 'w', indicating black-sounding and white-sounding. The column 'call' has two values, 1 and 0, indicating whether the resume received a call from employers or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the 'b' and 'w' values in race are assigned randomly to the resumes when presented to the employer."

Size of the sample N=2435 is large as well, meaning that the central limit theorem is applicable. Numbers of callbacks (for black and white sounding names) can be considered binomial random variables with the means mean_b and mean_w respectively. The standard deviations are std_w = sqrt(prob_w * (1- prob_w) N) and std_b = sqrt(prob_b * (1- prob_b) N).

This does not mean the presence of racial discrimination because the decision whether to make a callback or not could be based on numerical data given in other columns. To clarify the picture further, one should check whether the data for black and white sounding names in other columns are at least approximately the same. One should investigate the content of the columns that may play an important role in a callback decision: education, yearsexp, honors, volunteer, military, workinschoool, computerskills, specialskills and possibly some others. One can create additional column 'SKILLS' containing a numerical value corresponding to the weighted amount of all skills that play the role. After that one should do the similar statistical analysis, but test the hypothesis that means of callbacks for black and white sounding names are equal separately for candidates having one and the same rating in the 'SKILLS' column.
